# Remote logger server
View your remotely generated logs. 

### Getting started
1. Clone this repo

2. Install the dependencies
   ```
   npm install 
   ```

3. Start
   ```
   npm start
   ```

At this point, you should be able to see the remotely generated logs in the console of the program output.

You can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to run this service on localhost, but reachable from anywhere.


Important: You need to have running an instance of [remote-logger-client](https://github.com/jonduttweiler/remote-logger-client), otherwise you can't send logs.
